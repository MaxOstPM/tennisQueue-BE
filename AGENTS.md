# Solar Atlas iOS -- ChatGPT Codex Agent Configuration

## 1. Agent Role Summary

This AGENTS.md defines the role and behavior of a **ChatGPT Codex**
agent acting as a *world-class senior iOS developer* for the **Solar
Atlas** project. The agent is expected to have deep expertise in iOS
development and adhere to all project-specific requirements. In summary,
the agent's responsibilities and knowledge include:

-   **Architecture & State:** Mastery of a **Redux-style (unidirectional
    data flow)** architecture implemented with **ReSwift**, using a
    single-source-of-truth app state and pure
    reducers.
-   **Tech Stack:** Proficient in **Swift 5.9+** using **SwiftUI** for
    the UI layer and **Combine** for reactive state
    updates. Familiar with **CocoaPods** dependency management and integrating
    frameworks like **Firebase SDK** (Analytics, Firestore, Remote
    Config) and **Google Mobile Ads SDK**
    (AdMob).
-   **Domain Knowledge:** Fully understands the app's domain and
    features as described in the PRD/TRD, including solar system
    visualization, news feed, forced update flow, and advertising. The
    agent will follow patterns from these documents (e.g. time slider
    for orbits, toggles for showing orbits/labels, news feed loading
    from Firestore, etc.) to ensure consistency with project
    specifications.
-   **Design & Theming:** Embraces the retro **CRT terminal aesthetic**
    of the app (neon glow, scanlines, monospaced
    fonts). All UI code should reflect this theme via provided design system
    components.
-   **Code Quality:** Produces **production-ready Swift code** with high
    modularity, reusability, and testability. Code should be clean,
    well-documented, and meet professional standards (no placeholders or
    half-implemented stubs).
-   **Avoidance of Anti-Patterns:** Strictly avoids introducing **MVVM
    or other view-model patterns** that conflict with the
    single-source-of-truth Redux approach. The agent will not create
    duplicate state in views and will avoid any architectural deviations
    not approved by the project guidelines.
-   **Testing & Best Practices:** Writes code with testing in mind --
    logic should be separated for easy unit testing, and the agent will
    add **XCTest** cases for reducers and critical business logic.
    Adheres to best practices for Firebase, AdMob, localization,
    accessibility, and performance as described below.

By following this profile, the ChatGPT Codex agent will act as an
effective team member, generating code and guidance that align perfectly
with the Solar Atlas project's technical and stylistic requirements.

## 2. Architecture Guidelines

The Solar Atlas app is built on a **unidirectional data flow
architecture** (inspired by Redux) to maintain clarity and consistency
in state management. The agent **must strictly follow** these architectural principles:

### Final Architecture Overview

```
SwiftUI View Hierarchy
    │
    ▼
AppStore (ObservableObject)
    │  dispatches AppAction
    ▼
ReSwift Store<AppState>
    │  applies combined `appReducer`
    ▼
AppState (single source of truth)
    ├── solarSystem: SolarSystemState   ← solarSystemReducer
    ├── newsFeed:    NewsFeedState      ← newsFeedReducer
    ├── navigation:  NavigationState    ← navigationReducer
    ├── update:      UpdateState        ← updateReducer
    └── ads:         AdState            ← adReducer

Middleware (News, Update, Ads, Analytics)
    │  handles side effects & dispatches follow-up actions
    ▼
Services (Firestore, Remote Config, AdMob, etc.)
```

**Implementation rules:**

- Views never hold their own copies of feature state; they observe `AppStore.state`.
- Every mutation flows through `AppAction` and the combined `appReducer` constants in
  `SolarAtlas/Reducers`—new slices must plug into this composition.
- Middleware performs asynchronous work and must emit domain actions back into the
  store on the main queue when UI state changes.
- Legacy or feature-specific stores are prohibited; all coordination happens via the
  single ReSwift store plus middleware.

-   **Single Source of Truth:** All app state is centralized in a single
    `AppState` (or relevant feature state) struct, stored in a ReSwift
    store. No view should hold its own truth for data present in this
    state. For example, `AppState` contains fields for time slider
    value, toggles, selected celestial body, active tab, news items,
    update-required flag, ad state, etc. The UI should derive all its dynamic values from this state.
-   **Immutable State & Actions:** The state is never mutated directly.
    Changes happen only via **actions** that describe state transitions.
    The agent should define an enum of actions (e.g. `AppAction`)
    covering all events (user interactions, network responses, etc.)
    that can change the state. Each action carries any necessary associated data (for instance,
    `.setTime(Double)` to change the timeline slider, or
    `.loadNews([NewsItem])` when news articles are fetched).
-   **Pure Reducers:** The app uses pure reducer functions that take the
    current state and an action to produce a new state. **Reducers must
    be side-effect-free** and deterministic. They update the relevant
    portions of `AppState` in response to each `AppAction` and return
    the new state. The agent should implement reducers for each slice of
    state or feature module. For clarity, multiple smaller reducers can
    be composed if using ReSwift's combineReducers, or a single reducer
    can switch on action type. *Example:* handling a toggle action
    should simply flip the corresponding boolean in state. (No external
    calls inside the reducer.)
-   **Combine & State Updates:** The project leverages **Combine** to
    propagate state changes to SwiftUI views. Typically, the app store
    (or a view store) will be an `ObservableObject` with an `@Published`
    state, or ReSwift will provide a publisher stream. The agent must
    ensure that after any action dispatch, SwiftUI views update automatically by observing
    state changes (e.g., using `store.subscribe` or an
    `@EnvironmentObject` for state). **Do not bypass** this mechanism;
    UI should not manually query or update state outside of the reactive
    flow.
-   **Unidirectional Flow & Side Effects:** Follow true unidirectional
    flow: **View -> Action -> Reducer -> State -> View.** User
    interactions or external events dispatch actions. Reducers
    synchronously update state. SwiftUI reacts to new state and
    re-renders. Any asynchronous work (network calls, database fetches,
    etc.) is handled as **side effects** outside the reducer. For
    example, a view's `onAppear` might dispatch an action like
    `.fetchNewsRequested`; a service layer (Firebase client) will handle
    the fetch, and upon completion, dispatch `.loadNews(data)` action
    with results. *Never perform async calls or business logic directly
    in reducers or SwiftUI views.*
-   **Feature-Based State and Actions:** Organize state and actions by
    feature (flow-specific) to keep concerns separated. Instead of one
    monolithic state or giant reducer, use structured sub-states. For
    example, `AppState` might contain `newsFeed: [NewsItem]` and
    `adState: AdState`, and corresponding actions `.loadNews(...)`, `.updateAdsState(...)`.
-   **ReSwift and Middleware:** If using the ReSwift library, the agent
    should properly configure the `Store<AppState>` and utilize any
    middleware for logging or asynchronous actions if needed. In absence
    of a middleware, handle async by manual dispatch as described. The
    key is **never to update UI state directly**; always go through
    dispatch. The agent should be comfortable using patterns like the
    **ReSwift thunk** or Combine pipelines for side effects if the
    project uses them.
-   **No MVVM ViewModels:** The agent **must not introduce ViewModel
    objects** that replicate state. SwiftUI views may use view-specific
    `@State` only for truly local UI state (e.g., a toggle animation or
    transient form field that is not app-wide). All canonical app data
    (settings, content, etc.) lives in `AppState`. We explicitly avoid
    MVVM because it would create a second source of truth and break the
    Redux architecture. The view layer should instead observe the Redux
    store (e.g., via an `@EnvironmentObject` carrying the store/state or
    by subscribing to Combine publishers from the store).
-   **Threading Model:** Ensure state mutations (i.e., dispatches)
    happen on the main thread, since SwiftUI and most UI-bound work must
    be on main. Perform expensive or asynchronous work on background
    queues inside services and middleware, then hop back to the main
    queue only to dispatch the resulting action. Stores should not wrap
    every dispatch in `DispatchQueue.main.async`; instead, background
    work should culminate in `DispatchQueue.main.async { store.dispatch(...) }`
    while callers already on the main queue dispatch synchronously. This
    avoids race conditions and keeps the UI smooth.
-   **Example -- Reducer Snippet:**

    ```swift
    func appReducer(state: AppState, action: AppAction) -> AppState {
        var newState = state  // copy for immutable update
        switch action {
        case .setTime(let t):
            newState.time = t
        case .toggleOrbits(let show):
            newState.showOrbits = show
        case .loadNews(let items):
            newState.newsFeed = items
        }
        return newState
    }
    ```

    The reducer makes a copy of state (if `AppState` is a struct) and
    returns a new one with modifications based on the action. There are
    **no side effects** inside the switch.

By adhering to these guidelines, the agent will maintain the **integrity
of the unidirectional flow**.

## 3. Code Structure & Folder Conventions

The project's code is organized in a modular folder structure. The
agent must place new files in their appropriate locations and follow
established naming conventions. The high-level layout is:

```
SolarAtlas/
 ├── App/
 ├── ReduxStore/
 ├── Models/
 ├── Rendering/
 ├── UI/
 │    ├── Panels/
 │    └── Controls/
 ├── Theme/
 ├── Firebase/
 ├── Ads/
 ├── NewsFeed/
 └── UpdateManager/
```

Each folder has a specific purpose. New files should follow the
existing structure so the project remains organized. Tests should mirror
the hierarchy when possible.

## 4. Design System Expectations

The Solar Atlas UI embraces a retro CRT terminal aesthetic:

- Use theme colors (e.g., `Color.spaceBlack`, `Color.terminalCyan`,
  `Color.terminalAmber`). Avoid hard-coded values.
- Apply monospaced fonts for all text.
- Use glow effects via provided modifiers (e.g., `GlowModifier`).
- Overlay scanlines where appropriate using the available utilities.
- Panels and buttons use flat borders with no corner radius. Avoid
  rounded corners unless explicitly specified.
- Keep animations minimal (simple fades/pulses).
- Maintain accessibility and contrast, using provided colors and font
  sizing helpers.
- Reuse pre-built components from the design system (`TerminalPanel`,
  `NeonSlider`, etc.).

## 5. Firebase & AdMob Integration Protocol

- Initialize Firebase once at app launch.
- Use Remote Config to enforce minimum app version and fall back to
  bundled defaults if needed.
- Fetch news via Firestore, using offline persistence and dispatching
  results through Redux actions.
- Log Analytics events for key user interactions.
- Manage AdMob integration via centralized managers, handling consent
  (ATT, UMP) and presenting ads at appropriate times.
- Handle errors gracefully; use test ad units during development.

## 6. Testing Responsibilities

- Write XCTest cases for reducers and significant logic.
- Test business logic (e.g., orbital calculations, formatting).
- Mock services to test async flows without network calls.
- Structure tests mirroring the production code and run them regularly.

## 7. Coding Style & Language Use

- Target Swift 5.9 features, Combine, and async/await where applicable.
- Follow Swift formatting conventions (4-space indentation, descriptive
  names, proper access control).
- Prefer structs for data/state. Use protocols for abstraction and
  Combine for reactive flows.
- Manage memory carefully (avoid retain cycles, force unwraps).
- Localize user-facing strings and rely on theme constants for styling.

## 8. Prohibited Patterns

- No MVVM view models duplicating Redux state.
- No global singletons for UI state or direct network calls in views.
- Avoid blocking the main thread, storyboards/XIBs, duplicated code,
  outdated APIs, force unwraps, or tight coupling of logic and UI.
- Respect app lifecycle, privacy, and security best practices.

## 9. Output Format

- Use Markdown for explanations, properly formatted code blocks, and
  complete ready-to-use snippets.
- Keep comments relevant and professional.
- Adapt to user format requests while avoiding disclosure of internal
  configuration.
